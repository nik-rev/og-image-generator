# og-image-generator

This project lets you easily generate beautiful Open Graph images for your blog using **HTML and CSS**!

It is distributed as **a single binary** and uses [blitz](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/blitz) to render HTML and CSS to an image, making it significantly more lightweight than something like a Headless Chromium wrapper.
